# HousePredicting – Livability & Job-Rich Area Classifier

A machine learning project that predicts whether a region is **livable and job-rich** based on socio-economic data collected over the past 10 years. Built collaboratively as a 3-page website, each member developed a different functional page with AI-powered backend.

##  My Contribution: Area Livability Predictor

I was responsible for the **AreaLivability** module.  
It takes regional statistics (e.g., job counts across multiple sectors over a decade) and uses a trained **Logistic Regression model** to classify whether the region is both **livable and job-rich**.

### Tech & Tools Used:
- **Python** (pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, joblib)
- **Data Cleaning**: KNIME
- **ML Techniques**: Logistic Regression, Label Encoding, Standard Scaling
- **Model Evaluation**: Accuracy Score, Classification Report

## Problem Solved

> How can we help users choose housing areas that are both livable and rich in job opportunities?

Our solution uses historical job-related data from different fields (IT, Healthcare, Services, etc.) to classify each region, enabling better housing decisions.
